Think about and draw Database / model
Read up on Cake conventions for model & database
Go through Blog Tutorial Cake 

12:30

Create tables in DB, save create script
Cake bake tables

12:45 - 13:15

( ~~~ Lunch break ~~~ )

13:15

Start over but with Cake 2.7.3... (had set up Cake 3 before)
Figure out scaffolding / cake bake in 2.7.3

13:45

Generated NewsController and Model objects with cake bake
(Since I used scaffolding, I was unable to change the viewfiles. Disabled scaffolding in NewsController.)

14:20

Generated AdministratorController to add Login functionality
Administrator -> model: added validation on fields
Administrator -> Views: added 'add' + password hashing

15:20

Create loginfilter
Losing a lot of time with loginfilter --> has something to do with using Administrators instead of Users
-- solved by adding 
	'fields' => array(
        'username' => 'name',
        'password' => 'password'
    ),
    'userModel' => 'Administrator'
to AppController. "userModel" alone was not enough, username and password needed to be there too

16:20

Add News -> validation and setting the correct administrator

17:20

Clean up Admin Logout - Login

18:00

Display news items as list + make sure embargo doesn't get shown
(some trouble with query / conditions)

19:00 

Figure out how to do deploy + check in GIT

19:30

Deployed on webserver; clean up 

19:45

See if I can get images working...

20:04

Did not get images to work (time); found out there's loads of plugins for that kind of thing.
